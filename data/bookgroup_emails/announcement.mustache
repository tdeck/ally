<p>Thanks to everyone who joined us on Saturday for our recent book group. I've posted the next one <a href="{{{event_url}}}">here on meetup</a>.
{{^online_event}}
    Please RSVP if you're planning on coming so we don't run out of seats. {{#has_unusual_location}}Note the different location!{{/has_unusual_location}}

    </p>
<p>
    We're using Meetup RSVPs to keep the discussion to a manageable size, so <strong>please RSVP and add any +1s</strong> when you get your book to reserve a spot.
    I won't be sending the Zoom link out to everyone - those who have RSVP'd will see it on Meetup.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>If you aren't sure you'll read the book</strong>, help folks who have by RSVPing later to give them a chance. Likewise if you can't make it try
    to remove yourself early to free up a slot.
